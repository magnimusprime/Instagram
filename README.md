## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User Profiles:
   - [ ] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [ ] Display the profile photo with each post

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Parse and creating own api
2. resizing the image to fit into parse's requirements
